# Tea-bot [LEGACY] [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/fajsiex/tea-bot/badge/master)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/fajsiex/tea-bot/overview/master)
Custom-made discord chat bot that does some shit idk...

## Can I use it?
No. Except if I say so. You should use the new code (which is not done yet)

~~Yes, sure. However it wasn't designed to be used by other people.
If you want to use it, go ahead but be warned that you will need to change ***A LOT OF SHIT***~~

## Contributing
**Nope on legacy.** Feel free to do so in the normal repo

~~Nope. If you are not someone I know, then no. If yes, just fucking ask me.~~
