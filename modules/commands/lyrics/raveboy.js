Be, be my rave boy
We can have some fun
Dancing together til the morning sun
My heart is racing
If only you knew
I can't imagine my life without you
Be, be my rave boy
We can have some fun
Dancing together til the morning sun
My heart is racing
If only you knew

I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine my life without you
I can't imagine

Be, be my rave boy
We can have some fun
Dancing together til the morning sun
My heart is racing
If only you knew
I can't imagine my life without you
I can just imagine
Our cute raver life
Holding hands together
Under laser lights
Waiting for the buildup
So we can lose our minds
If only you knew
I want to make you mine

Want to make you mine
Want to make you mine
Want to make you mine
Want to make you mine
Want to make you mine
Want to make you mine
If only you knew
I want to make you mine

Be my-
Be, be my rave boy
We can have some fun
Dancing together til the morning sun
My heart is racing
If only you knew
I can't imagine my life without you

I can just imagine
Our cute raver life
Holding hands together
Under laser lights
Waiting for the buildup
So we can lose our minds
If only you knew
I want to make you mine
